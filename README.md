## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is BloatBuster?

BloatBuster is a macOS app that helps developers reclaim disk space by cleaning build artifacts and dependencies from development projects. It supports 15+ project types including Node.js, Rust, Python, Swift, Xcode, Unity, and more.

### Is it safe to use?

Yes! BloatBuster only removes build artifacts and dependencies that can be regenerated. Your source code and project files are **never touched**. Common artifacts cleaned include:

- `node_modules`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.turbo` (Node.js/JavaScript frameworks)
- `target` (Rust)
- `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`, `dist` (Python)
- `.build` (Swift Package Manager)
- `build` (Xcode)
- `build`, `.gradle` (Java/Gradle)
- `bin`, `obj`, `.vs` (.NET)
- And many more...

### How do I use BloatBuster?

1. Drag and drop any folder onto the BloatBuster window
2. BloatBuster will scan for development projects and their build artifacts
3. Select the projects you want to clean using the checkboxes
4. Click "Clean Selected" to remove the bloat and reclaim disk space

### What project types are supported?

BloatBuster supports 15+ development environments:

| Project Type | Artifacts Cleaned |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Node.js | `node_modules`, `.next`, `.nuxt`, `.turbo`, `.parcel-cache`, `.svelte-kit`, `dist`, `build` |
| React Native | `node_modules`, `ios/build`, `ios/Pods`, `android/build`, `android/.gradle`, `vendor/bundle` |
| Tauri | `node_modules`, `src-tauri/target`, `dist` |
| Rust | `target` |
| Python | `__pycache__`, `.venv`, `venv`, `.pytest_cache`, `.mypy_cache`, `.ruff_cache`, `.tox`, `.nox`, `dist`, `.eggs`, `__pypackages__`, `.ipynb_checkpoints` |
| Swift Package Manager | `.build` |
| Xcode | `build` |
| Java | `target`, `build`, `.gradle` |
| .NET/C# | `bin`, `obj`, `.vs` |
| Unity | `Library`, `Temp`, `Obj`, `Logs` |
| Godot | `.godot`, `.import` |
| CMake | `build` |
| PHP | `vendor` |
| Dart/Flutter | `.dart_tool`, `build` |
| Elixir | `_build` |
| CocoaPods | `Pods` |

### How much space can I save?

It depends on your projects! A typical Node.js project with `node_modules` can range from 100MB to over 1GB. Rust projects with compiled `target` folders can be several GBs. Unity projects can have multi-GB `Library` folders.

Users commonly report saving **10-100+ GB** after scanning their development folders.

### Can I recover deleted files?

No, the deletion is permanent. However, since BloatBuster only removes regenerable artifacts, you can always restore them by:

- Running `npm install` for Node.js projects
- Running `cargo build` for Rust projects
- Running `pip install` for Python projects
- Rebuilding your Xcode projects
- etc.

### Does BloatBuster require internet access?

No, BloatBuster works completely offline. It only scans your local file system.

### Why does the scan take a while?

BloatBuster performs a thorough scan of your entire folder structure to find all development projects. The time depends on:

- Number of folders and files
- Disk speed (SSD vs HDD)
- Number of nested projects

BloatBuster uses parallel scanning to make this as fast as possible.

### Can I exclude certain folders from scanning?

Currently, BloatBuster scans the entire folder you drop. You can work around this by:

- Dropping specific project folders instead of your entire development directory
- Unchecking projects you don't want to clean in the results view

### What macOS version is required?

BloatBuster requires **macOS 14.0 or later**.
